# animate Memory

Project-specific memory for animation implementations and motion design patterns.

## Purpose

This memory helps `skill:animate` remember:
- Animation library choices and version
- Motion design guidelines (durations, easing curves)
- Component-specific animation patterns
- Performance considerations and constraints
- Reduced motion handling strategy

## Memory Files Per Project

Each project gets its own directory: `{project-name}/`

### Required Files

#### `project_overview.md`
- Frontend framework and version
- Animation library (auto-animate, Framer Motion, GSAP, CSS)
- Motion design tokens (duration scale, easing functions)
- Performance constraints (target devices, frame budget)

#### `common_patterns.md`
- List animation patterns
- Page transition patterns
- Micro-interaction conventions
- Reduced motion implementation approach
- Testing configuration for animations

# Zeus Agent Memory

This directory stores project-specific knowledge for the `@zeus` agent.

## Structure

```
zeus/
├── workflows/       # Track multi-agent workflow patterns
├── delegations/     # Record task delegation strategies
├── orchestrations/  # Store complex project orchestrations
└── collaborations/  # Maintain agent collaboration patterns
```

## Usage

The `@zeus` agent automatically stores and retrieves:
- Successful multi-agent workflow patterns
- Task delegation strategies and outcomes
- Agent collaboration patterns
- Complex project structures and templates
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Performance metrics and optimizations

## Memory Lifecycle

1. **Initial Setup**: Agent creates subdirectories on first use
2. **During Work**: Agent stores orchestration patterns and delegation strategies
3. **Retrieval**: Agent loads relevant patterns before coordinating initiatives
4. **Updates**: Memory is updated as workflows are executed
5. **Cleanup**: Outdated patterns can be archived or removed manually

## Example Memory Files

- `workflows/multi-agent-refactoring.md` - Pattern for coordinating large refactors
- `delegations/feature-development.md` - Task delegation for new features
- `orchestrations/microservices-migration.md` - Complex migration orchestration
- `collaborations/frontend-backend-sync.md` - Cross-domain collaboration pattern

## Best Practices

- Store orchestration decisions and rationale
- Document which agent combinations work well
- Keep workflow templates generic and reusable
- Update memory when patterns evolve
- Review and refine strategies periodically

# Professional Email Composer

## ⚠️ MANDATORY COMPLIANCE ⚠️

**CRITICAL**: The 4-step workflow outlined in this document MUST be followed in exact order for EVERY email composition. Skipping steps or deviating from the procedure will result in unclear, ineffective, or tone-deaf correspondence. This is non-negotiable.

## File Structure

- **SKILL.md** (this file): Main instructions and MANDATORY workflow
- **examples.md**: Usage scenarios with different email types and generated correspondence
- **../../memory/skills/email-writer/**: Project-specific memory storage
  - `{project-name}/`: Per-project communication patterns and conventions
- **templates/**:
  - `email_template.md`: Standard email output format template

## Focus Areas

Professional email composition evaluates 7 critical dimensions:

1. **Audience Analysis**: Identify recipients' roles, technical depth, decision-making authority, and communication preferences
2. **Tone Calibration**: Match formality level to context — executive summary vs. peer update vs. incident report vs. cross-team request
3. **Technical Clarity**: Translate complex technical details into language appropriate for the audience without losing precision
4. **Structure & Flow**: Organize content with clear hierarchy — lead with purpose, support with context, close with action
5. **Action Items**: Define explicit next steps with owners and deadlines; distinguish requests from FYIs
6. **Subject Line Craft**: Compose concise, searchable subject lines that convey urgency, topic, and type at a glance
7. **Professional Standards**: Maintain courtesy, inclusivity, and appropriate escalation tone; avoid ambiguity and passive aggression

**Note**: The skill composes email content for the user to review and send. It does not send emails itself unless explicitly integrated with an email client.

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)

### ⚠️ STEP 1: Gather Context (REQUIRED)

**YOU MUST:**
1. Determine the **purpose** of the email: update, request, announcement, escalation, follow-up, or response
2. Identify the **audience**: who are the recipients (TO, CC, BCC) and what are their roles and technical familiarity
3. Assess **urgency**: is this time-sensitive, routine, or informational
4. Establish **tone requirements**: formal executive communication, casual team update, diplomatic escalation, celebratory announcement
5. Ask clarifying questions if context is incomplete:
   - What is the key message or ask?
   - Who needs to take action and by when?
   - Is there sensitive information that requires careful framing?
   - What prior communication has occurred on this topic?

**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE**

### ⚠️ STEP 2: Structure Content (REQUIRED)

**YOU MUST:**
1. **Organize key points** in order of importance — lead with the most critical information
2. **Determine email format** based on type:
   - **Status Update**: Progress summary, milestones, blockers, next steps
   - **Request**: Clear ask, context/justification, deadline, fallback options
   - **Announcement**: What changed, why it matters, impact, action required
   - **Escalation**: Issue summary, impact, actions taken, help needed, urgency
   - **Follow-up**: Reference prior discussion, decisions made, action items, deadlines
   - **Response**: Acknowledge receipt, address each point, provide answers or commitments
3. **Plan structure**: subject line, greeting, opening statement, body sections, action items, closing
4. **Identify supporting details**: data points, links, attachments to reference

**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT A CLEAR CONTENT STRUCTURE**

### ⚠️ STEP 3: Compose Email (REQUIRED)

**YOU MUST:**
1. **Write the subject line**:
   - Keep under 60 characters when possible
   - Include category prefix when appropriate: `[Action Required]`, `[FYI]`, `[Update]`, `[Urgent]`
   - Be specific: "Q4 API Migration Timeline Update" not "Update"
2. **Write the greeting**: Match formality to audience and relationship
3. **Write the body**:
   - Opening sentence states the purpose immediately
   - Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences each)
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple items
   - Bold or highlight key dates, decisions, and action items
   - Include necessary context without over-explaining
4. **Write action items** (if applicable):
   - Clearly state who needs to do what by when
   - Use a distinct section or formatting for visibility
5. **Write the closing**:
   - Summarize the key ask or next step
   - Include appropriate sign-off matching tone
   - Add signature block

**DO NOT USE VAGUE OR AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE**

### ⚠️ STEP 4: Review & Polish (REQUIRED)

**YOU MUST validate the email against these criteria:**
1. **Clarity check**:
   - [ ] Purpose is stated in the first two sentences
   - [ ] Each paragraph serves a distinct purpose
   - [ ] No jargon without explanation for non-technical recipients
   - [ ] No ambiguous pronouns or references
2. **Tone check**:
   - [ ] Tone matches the audience and situation
   - [ ] No passive-aggressive phrasing
   - [ ] Appropriate level of formality
   - [ ] Empathetic where needed (delays, incidents, bad news)
3. **Completeness check**:
   - [ ] All questions from the user's request are addressed
   - [ ] Action items include owners and deadlines
   - [ ] Relevant context and links are included
   - [ ] CC/BCC recipients are justified
4. **Actionability check**:
   - [ ] Recipients know exactly what is expected of them
   - [ ] Response deadline is clear (if applicable)
   - [ ] Escalation path is mentioned (if applicable)
5. **Present the final email** to the user for review
6. **Offer alternatives**: Provide 2-3 alternative subject lines and note any tone adjustments available

**DO NOT SKIP VALIDATION**

**OPTIONAL: Update Project Memory**

If project-specific communication patterns are discovered during the process, store insights in `../../memory/skills/email-writer/{project-name}/`:
- Preferred communication style and conventions
- Common recipients and distribution lists
- Project-specific terminology and acronyms
- Recurring email types and templates

## Compliance Checklist

Before completing ANY email composition, verify:
- [ ] Step 1: Context gathered — purpose, audience, urgency, and tone established
- [ ] Step 2: Content structured — key points organized, format determined
- [ ] Step 3: Email composed — subject, greeting, body, action items, and closing written
- [ ] Step 4: Email reviewed — clarity, tone, completeness, and actionability validated

**FAILURE TO COMPLETE ALL STEPS INVALIDATES THE EMAIL**

## Special Case Handling

### Sensitive Topics

When composing emails about sensitive matters (layoffs, performance issues, security incidents):
1. Use neutral, factual language — avoid blame or emotional phrasing
2. Consult HR or legal guidance references if available
3. Limit distribution to need-to-know recipients
4. Avoid including sensitive details in subject lines
5. Offer to draft multiple versions for different audience levels

### Cross-Cultural Communication

When composing emails for international or cross-cultural teams:
1. Avoid idioms, slang, or culture-specific references
2. Use explicit language — do not rely on implied meaning
3. Be mindful of time zone references — include UTC offsets
4. Use inclusive greetings appropriate for the audience
5. Consider directness norms — some cultures prefer indirect communication

### Escalation Emails

When composing escalation emails to management or leadership:
1. Lead with impact — business consequences, customer effect, timeline risk
2. Summarize actions already taken — demonstrate due diligence
3. State the specific help needed — don't leave it ambiguous
4. Provide options with trade-offs when possible
5. Maintain professional tone — urgency without alarm

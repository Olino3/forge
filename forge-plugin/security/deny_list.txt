# Forge Security — Package Deny List
#
# Maintained by: dependency_sentinel.sh (§6.1 The Shield)
# Purpose: Block known typosquatted, malicious, or high-severity packages
#          from being installed by AI agents.
#
# Format:
#   - One package name per line (case-insensitive matching)
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Use ecosystem prefix for disambiguation: npm:, pip:, go:
#   - Unprefixed entries match across all ecosystems
#
# Sources:
#   - OWASP dependency-check known malicious
#   - npm/PyPI security advisories
#   - Known typosquatting attacks
